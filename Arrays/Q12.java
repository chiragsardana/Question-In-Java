/*
Use a two-dimensional array to solve the following problem: A company has four salespeople (1 to 4) 
who sell five different products (1 to 5). 
Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each type of product sold. 
Each slip contains the following:
a) The salesperson number
b) The product number
c) The total dollar value of that product sold that day
Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day. Assume that the information 
from all the slips for last month is available. Write an application that will read all this information 
for last weekâ€™s sales and summarize the total sales by salesperson and by product. 

Definition of Done:
    a) All totals should be stored in the two-dimensional array sales. 
    b) Results should be displayed in a tabular format, with each column representing a salesperson and 
    each row representing a particular product. 
    c) Cross-total of each row should get the total sales of each product for last week. 
    d) Cross-total of each column should get the total sales by the salesperson for last week. 
    The output should include these cross-totals to the right of the totalled rows and to the bottom of the totalled columns.
